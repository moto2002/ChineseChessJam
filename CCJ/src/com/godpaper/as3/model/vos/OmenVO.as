	 * (2) the important positions, </br>
	 * (3) the flexibility of the pieces, </br>
	 * (4) the threats between pieces and the protection of pieces from threats, </br>

		//King is the most important piece. Its value is much larger than the total power of all other pieces. The values of
		//the other pieces are determined by heuristic rules. The power of one Rook is similar to one Horse plus one
		//Cannon. The power of one Horse is similar to two Elephants. Based on these heuristic rules, ELP gives the
		//following values to pieces (see Table 5).
